Below is a simplified example of improved separation of concerns in rendering logic in Python without comments:

```python
class Model:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

class Renderer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def render(self, data):
        # Rendering logic here
        print("Rendering data:", data)

class Controller:
    def __init__(self, model, renderer):
        self.model = model
        self.renderer = renderer

    def process_data(self):
        # Process data logic here
        processed_data = self.model.data * 2
        self.renderer.render(processed_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = "Hello, world!"
    model = Model(data)
    renderer = Renderer()
    controller = Controller(model, renderer)
    controller.process_data()
```

In this code:

- `Model` represents the data and business logic.
- `Renderer` is responsible for rendering the data.
- `Controller` acts as an intermediary between the model and the renderer. It processes the data and then instructs the renderer to render it.
- The `Controller` contains an instance of the `Model` and the `Renderer`.
- When the `Controller` processes the data, it calls the `render` method of the `Renderer` to render the processed data.
- The `Renderer` is responsible for rendering the data and has no knowledge of the data processing logic.

This separation of concerns improves the maintainability and testability of the code by clearly defining the responsibilities of each component.
